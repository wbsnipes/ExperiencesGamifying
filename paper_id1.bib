It addresses the problem that the log data recorded by standard web servers is not sufficient for the tracking of users on AJAX websites, e.g. to conduct a usability test. Using standard web technologies, our HTTP proxy can record very detailed usage information, such as mouse movements, clicks, key presses and scrolling, together with the exact HTML DOM tree objects involved. As we show in several case studies, the tracking also works across multiple websites, none of which needs to be under our control. This approach is much less invasive than previous efforts: The test person does not need to install software on her computer, and in certain operation modes, no configuration changes at all are required on her computer. Our research indicates that if the technology described in this paper is employed, arbitrary visitors of a website are more likely to take part in a usability test offered by that site -- this facilitates recruiting test participants over the Internet.}},

Since the behavior exhibited by individual developers when investigating a software system is influenced by intuition, experience, and skill, there is often significant variability in developer effectiveness. To understand the factors that contribute to effective program investigation behavior, we conducted a study of five developers performing a change task on a medium-size open source system. We isolated the factors related to effective program investigation behavior by performing a detailed qualitative analysis of the program investigation behavior of successful and unsuccessful developers. We report on these factors as a set of detailed observations, such as evidence of the phenomenon of inattention blindness by developers skimming source code. In general, our results support the intuitive notion that a methodical and structured approach to program investigation is the most effective.}},

Conclusions are that developers can be more effective using a methodological and structured approach relying on the structure of the program than approaches relying upon naming conventions and browsing the code.  Key points proven is that developers who understand the code and create a detailed plan for implementing the change are faster and more succesful.  Develpers who use structured navigation through dependencies and relationships and keyword searchs in the code are more successful than developers who scan the text looking for methods or other elements.  One factor may be a psychological effect known as inattention blindness where people not searching for something will miss the occurrence.  "e.g. gorilla on basketball court video".  Developers who did not reinvestigate methods frequently were more successful.  },

While there are several potential technical solutions to this difficulty, we know little about social solutions, such as one user telling a peer about a tool. To explore these social solutions in one particular domain, we describe a series of interviews with 18 programmers in industry that explore how tool discovery takes place. These interviews provide a rich set of qualitative data that give us detailed insights into how programmers discover tools. One finding was that, while programmers believe that discovery from peers is effective, they actually discover tools from peers relatively infrequently. Another finding was that programmers can effectively discover tools from their peers both in a co-located and remote settings. We describe several implications of our findings, such as that discovery from peers can be enhanced by improving programmers' ability to communicate openly and concisely about tools.}},

However, little has been reported about the adoption of refactoring tools, and many assumptions about refactoring practice have little empirical support. In this paper, we examine refactoring tool usage and evaluate some of the assumptions made by other researchers. To measure tool usage, we randomly sampled code changes from four Eclipse and eight Mylyn developers and ascertained, for each refactoring, if it was performed manually or with tool support. We found that refactoring tools are seldom used: 11 percent by Eclipse developers and 9 percent by Mylyn developers. To understand refactoring practice at large, we drew from a variety of data sets spanning more than 39,000 developers, 240,000 tool-assisted refactorings, 2,500 developer hours, and 12,000 version control commits. Using these data, we cast doubt on several previously stated assumptions about how programmers refactor, while validating others. Finally, we interviewed the Eclipse and Mylyn developers to help us understand why they did not use refactoring tools and to gather ideas for future research.}},

Hence, we present an approach for discovering and tracking evolving user profiles. We also describe how the discovered user profiles can be enriched with explicit information need that is inferred from search queries extracted from Web log data. Profiles are also enriched with other domain-specific information facets that give a panoramic view of the discovered mass usage modes.

Such information is usually lost by state-of-the-art versioning systems, because of the checkin/checkout model they rely on: a developer must explicitly commit his changes to the repository. Since this happens in arbitrary and sometimes long intervals, recovering the changes between two commits is difficult and inaccurate, and recovering the order of the changes is impossible. We have implemented an evolution monitoring prototype which records every semantic change performed on a system, and is able to completely reconstruct development sessions. In this paper we use this fine-grained information to understand and characterize the development sessions as they were carried out on two object-oriented systems.}},

    comment = {(private-note)A positive indicator is that 55\% would be interested in working for a company that offers games as a way to increase productivity.  A work setting could ramp up the competitive motivation that is fairly low 31\% compared with the findings that 57\% use social games for  'passing time when bored'.

It is also interesting that 85\% of people would spend a half hour or more playing a game for a chance at a monetary award.  This counters some of the motivation literature I've studied who say that monetary awards are much lower on the motivation scale than recognition.
