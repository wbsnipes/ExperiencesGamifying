\begin{abstract}
As software development practices evolve, we face the continuous challenge of communicating new practices and tools to the community.  As developers, we both like to try new things and like to stick with the familiar.  In addition to training, discussing, and presenting software engineering practices and tools, we seek to communicate them through active two-way information embedded in the Integrated Development Environment (IDE).  While communicating, we also collect data on new and current practices and tools used by each developer by recording actions in the IDE.  With a rich data source, we evaluate what practices are used, define metrics that give individual feedback, and create an environment where developers can see how they are doing compared with their teammates.  

This approach helps understand practice and tool use over the long term and judges the lasting change a communication effort makes in everyday habits.  Tool support provides a mechanism to embed into Visual Studio an extension that provides the capture of usage data while giving feedback to users on their practices both in general and specific to the ones being promoted.  Through a points score system that assigns points to specific commands and tools we encourage everyone to use the new practices.  Providing a light score ranking view should help us stay motivated as we compare our command usage to our peers.  To demonstrate how this works, we implement a longitudinal study that demonstrates the results from this approach as we engage with developers over a month-long period.  

Results from this demonstrative study show that in general the approach is <blank> with a few developers <blank> of the study.  The effectiveness of this approach for communicating about practices is demonstrated through the continued use of the commands as we communicate them.  Evaluation of metrics for navigation ratio over time show that developer use the commands <blank> than they did during the benchmarking phase.  The result of the study shows that this method for communicating and promoting software engineering tools and practices <blank>.

\section{Introduction}
%update
Deploying these techniques requires communicating and motivating developers to use them.  Murphy-Hill and colleagues  \cite{wbsnipes:Hill2011Peer} show that developers can effectively learn about new tools from their peers by watching them work and through recommendations, yet this happens very rarely, in part because developers rarely work on the same computer at the same time.  This personal connection limits the knowledge transfer to the co-located circle of colleagues connected with the early adopters.  



\section{Assess the Viability of Gamification for Software Engineering}

\subsection{Assessment Background}
When discussing gamification, folks raise a concern about replacing an activity that is intrinsically motivated with extrinsic motivation provided by points and achievements.  To discover what is behind this concern, several studies are useful to understand what should be done. 

Early studies attempt to evaluate achievement motivation in students and relate that to their performance in school.  The study by Hermans describes results from applying questionnaire to evaluate achievement motivation in students \cite{wbsnipes:Hermans1970Questionnaire}.  Each question is ranked for its correlation to achievement motivation. Results indicate that some key questions about the diligence with which students approach their work are correlated with achievement motivation.  The questions in this questionnaire and their ranking may be useful for evaluating achievement motivation in further studies.  Take care when choosing appropriate questions that for the context of the survey.

Maehr proposes an affirmative theory that individuals achieve as a member of a social group choosing the behavior that will meet the expectations and values of the group that is significant to them. \cite{wbsnipes:MaehrCulture}  So the presence of a social group where the person is motivated to belong and excel within is important for creating achievement motivation.  Maehr states that since achievement behaviors can be triggered by circumstance, that they are present in most people regardless of background. 

Beecham and colleagues provide a thorough analysis of existing literature on studies of motivation in Software Engineering\cite{wbsnipes:Beecham2008Motivation}. It has some valuable lists of factors that motivate software engineers with the most common being "the work" motivates us. The list of de-motivators is also useful with common job satisfaction items like stress and inequity in recognition, plus poor quality software (low accomplishment) and lack of influence in decision making. The paper also lists characteristics of people in the professions including need for independence (autonomy), desire to learn new skills/tackle challenges. 

Understanding the concerns with maintaining intrinsic motivation while adding elements of achievement motivation, we developed an assessment survey questionnaire to determine whether the community would be receptive to a gamification approach to software development.   We designed  the survey to assess how developers are motivated to use training, practices, and tools and whether they are open to having that information shared with their peers and managers, and being recognized with badges and points. The developer study conducted with over 130 software developers at ABB challenged whether achievement motivation would help software engineers and whether they would accept sharing data on tools and practices they use to help others.

\subsection{Assessment Results}

Using a question from the Saachi and Saachi survey\cite{wbsnipes:SaatchiGameification} as directly as possible, we asked developers at ABB "How interested they would be in working for a company that incorporated some aspects of games into software engineering tools as a way to increase productivity in the workplace"?  We segmented results by country in Figure \ref{fig:gamification} and found that gamification of software engineering is more interesting to developers in India, Poland, and Finland than in other major countries.  The responses indicating that developers were at least somewhat interested is 75-88\% In India, Poland, and Finland.  For the US, Sweden, and Switzerland the responses indicate 60-65\% are at least somewhat interested.  The overall ABB response is comparable to the Saachi and Saaschi survey\cite{wbsnipes:SaatchiGameification} upon which this question was based that found 75\% of 18-45 year olds were at least somewhat interested.  

\begin{figure}\begin{mdframed}[linecolor=white]
	\includegraphics[width=3in]{gamificationquestion.pdf}
	\caption{Acceptance of gamification}
	\label{fig:gamification}
\end{mdframed}\end{figure}

We asked developers how likely they would be to try tools and practices recommended to them through an automated usage tracking system.  Answers showed that 95\% of the developers surveyed are likely to try tools and practices recommended to them.  This indicates that a recommendation system would positively impact the deployment of software engineering tools and practices at ABB.

One area we questioned was whether sharing detailed usage information with colleagues and the company as a whole would be a concern for developers.  A graduated scale was used for the community that would be shared with and distinction between whether that sharing was anonymous or the information was personally identifiable. Figure \ref{fig:comfortwithsharing}  shows that over 90\% of respondents are comfortable with sharing either anonymous or non-anonymous information with their team members. 
Their comfort level decreases as the scope of who the information is shared with increases.  People were less comfortable sharing with anyone (the category for people outside ABB) particularly if the data were not anonymous.  
Two conclusions from this feedback are that people are very willing to share information that could help their team. Second, sharing within the company is acceptable if we take care to make the data anonymous.

	\includegraphics[width=3in]{ComfortWithSharing.pdf}
	\caption{Comfortable with sharing usage information}
	\label{fig:comfortwithsharing}
\end{mdframed}\end{figure}

Developers were asked what would motivate them to use tools and practices and given 4 choices to rank.  The top motivator for using tools and practices is coworker recommendation with 75\% of respondents in Figure \ref{fig:toolandpracticemotivators}   ranking in 1st or 2nd place. The lowest was having badges posted on their social profile where 33\% ranked this in 1st or 2nd place.   Badges also ranked low in motivations for taking more software engineering training.  We conclude that a facility to share coworker recommendations on tools and practices has the best opportunity to increase their adoption.  Since a competition among teams ranks slightly higher than management mandate, we have the choice to apply one or the other or both as motivation for using key practices.

	\includegraphics[width=3in]{ToolAndPracticeMotivators.pdf}
	\caption{Motivation for using tools and practices}
	\label{fig:toolandpracticemotivators}
\end{mdframed}\end{figure}

Developers were asked to rank awards for different actions by which they would find the most desirable.  Overall 68\% of developers ranked receiving an award for consistently performing quality practices as either 1st or 2nd place.  This supports a conclusion that focusing on awarding quality practices would motivate developers to do them consistently.
 
Based on the survey results we draw the following conclusions:
•	95\% of developer responding would try tools and practices suggested by an automated recommendation system particularly if they were provided in context with the current workflow pattern the developer follows.
•	Responses indicate a preference for team competition over individual awards (badges) and awards for quality practices ranked highest.  So, the tool will incorporate team competition ideas and recognize quality practices.
•	Over 90\% of respondents approved of sharing data with their team members


\section{Study Design}
Creating a longitudinal study involves defining a long-term goal that is measurable in increments, determining the discrete steps that the study will use to communicate the goal to the participants, distribute interventions to participants, and track participants progress over time.  Many software engineering studies are conducted at discrete points in time via surveys of sampled participants.  Perhaps prior to an intervention, and multiple points following an intervention.  This study demonstrates a method to perform an intervention, continuously monitor the progress of participant response to that intervention, and provide continuous feedback to the participant and researchers about the progress.  Continuous meaning that no information gaps exist in the data collection, there are no periods of unmonitored activity by the participant.  Continuous also applies to the intervention being evaluated, where the participant and researchers receive constant feedback about the conformance to the intervention's purpose.  Studying an intervention in a continuous context determines how sticky the intervention is in the mind of the developer.  It can remove bias that might be introduced by periodic surveys or audits and enhance the habits formed in the participant receiving the intervention.

Designing the study with continuous measurement but no control group presents a traditional study design with some challenges.  We overcame this by dividing the study into phases where the participants themselves form a control group.  The first phase baselines their activities determining the current state of their practices.  The second phase presents the intervention to the participants.  This phase the participants do not receive continuous feedback on their compliance with the intervention.  This phase simulates the traditional approach of communicating an intervention then returning with an audit to determine whether participants are complaint with it.   The last phases turns on continuous feedback to the participants on their compliance with the intervention.  As they receive the feedback, the participants can determine for themselves how much they are implementing the intervention.  In the last phase they possess complete knowledge of the intervention and their compliance with it making it plausible that they can continuously control their compliance.

Developing the study with the available tooling means that we follow steps as follows.
1. Define the practice we wish to measure compliance with
2. Develop a mapping of the practice to actions that are captured by the blaze tool from the IDE
3. Weight the actions according to their importance to the practice and assign points to the actions in the configuration file
4. Develop the intervention method
5. Determine the phases and length of the phase in the study according to baseline, intervention, and continuous feedback
6. Select participants to deploy
7. Define a pre-study questionnaire if one is necessary to collect associated information
8. Define a post-study questionnaire if necessary to collect post study information
9. Communicate with the participants about the study
10. Execute the study and report results

\subsection{Setup the practice}

Gamification motivates people to achieve goals through incremental scoring and discrete awards that are typically shared with peers in an on line community.  Companies are gamifying their business processes and even public facing web sites to encourage people to complete a task such as their profile, stay loyal by earning rewards (air miles), or participate frequently by being part of a community.  Aspects of Gamification that should be considered when applying this popular technique to a process or system include motivational alignment, whether to include the competitive dimension, and making achievements encouraging.  

First it is important to consider the existing motivation people may have for performing the activity.  Applying gamification to activities that people are motivated intrinsically to do may decrease their motivation.  For example applying gamification to education is very difficult because learners are typically intrinsically motivated more than extrinsically motivated to achieve in their education \cite{wbsnipes:Vansteenkiste2008Does}.    In other words they are mostly interested in learning to better themselves rather than earn the highest GPA.   If an activity is primarily extrinsically motivated then gamification is an easy fit to directly apply to the activity.

Several studies support the use of games as a learning aid or as the core part of a training program.  Naicker, Vincent and Adams \cite{wbsnipes:Amory1999Use} studied which type of computer game had the best response for enjoyment of play among undergraduate students.  The authors concluded that adventure games provide the best foundation for development of teaching resources.  Students rated sound, graphics, story line, and use of technology as important game elements.

Selecting a practice to study involves defining specific characteristics of the practice and how capturing actions in Visual Studio relates to the practice.  In this study we selected the structured navigation practice shown by Robillard et. al. as correlated with effective program maintenance \cite{wbsnipes:Robillard2004How} .  Studying structured navigation is a natural fit for capturing commands issued in the IDE.  The first step is to create the classification of commands that are involved in navigation.  Then differentiate which commands we consider as structured navigation from unstructured navigation.  

The Blaze tool provides an XML configuration file that allows defining multiple levels of categories for commands thus we can categorize commands that are navigation then further classify them into structured and unstructured navigation.
We classified commands as structured navigation when they allow the developer to locate a code element following the program structure from another element.  For example, Navigate To \textit{Ctrl+,}, Go To Definition \textit{F12}, and Find All References \textit{Ctrl+K,R} are commands that follow structure of the code that we classify as structured navigation.
Commands that we considered as unstructured navigation include scrolling through a file using keys or the scroll-bar, opening files from the Solution Explorer, Find commands (e.g. Find in Files), Go-to line number, and children of these commands (e.g. Find Next).

Another factor to consider is the design of achievement awards and points.  The design of achievement awards should gradually encourage the participant to reach higher and higher levels of success in the activity.  Achievements must feel earned to the participant so that internally they recognize the effort to get the award was significant and feel satisfied  \cite{wbsnipes:Hamari2011Framework}.  Hamari and Eranti describe a general relationship between achievements in games and regular game play  \cite{wbsnipes:Hamari2011Framework} .  How those achievements are awarded to players, and the concept of levels of achievements.  The article contains a warning that assigning achievements to tasks reduces intrinsic motivation because autonomy is reduced by the achievements.   In games achievements are typically a parallel scoring system to the main game play.  They make the game more engaging providing multiple ways to increase your score and multiple challenges in one interface.

Using these guidelines we assigned points to structured navigation commands which received 1-10 points each while unstructured navigation commands received 0 points.  Assigning negative points is discouraged as this may demotivate folks who do not have detailed knowledge of how the points are assigned.   In creating levels, following the guidance from Hamari \cite{wbsnipes:Hamari2011Framework}, we built levels following an exponential curve.  At first users level up after a working day or two worth of activity initially extending to a week or even a month following an exponential curve  making the game motivating for beginners and challenging for more experienced developers.  We designed the points and levels such that above average developers can complete all levels during the study period.

\subsection{Study Intervention and Participants}

After selecting the practice to focus on, we needed to select an intervention method.  The term intervention, indicates that we are seeking to influence developers to perform a practice previously defined by software engineering community.  Intervention involves communication about the practice in a way that motivates adoption \cite{}.  Interventions can include presentations, one-on-one discussions, distance education mechanisms such as webinars, and word of mouth recommendations.  Part of the research objective is to determine whether we can achieve adoption of a practice with alternative interventions that are more deliberate than word of mouth and perhaps more scalable than webinars or presentations.  Utilizing the automation capabilities of Blaze, we chose to automatically pop-up a window with training information on structured navigation practices and tools. For this study we chose to make a nice looking graphic that users click on to see information about navigation commands, obtain and install the Sando search tool, and learn about the Blaze game.  The site uses a combination of video and blog-post style information easily accessible to the developer.  The usefulness of the communication site is rated as part of our study completion survey.

The study established three time periods, a preliminary period to establish a baseline, a period where information is communicated but no immediate feedback or points are displayed, and a period where points are displayed and all information is available.  We chose to deploy the Blaze tool without communicating the study purpose for the baseline period so that an accurate picture of the baseline could be captured by the tool.  Then the tool would pop-up a display with the information on the communication web site asking the developers to consume the information and begin using the practices.   Finally the display of points fo accumulated by the developer provides the instant feedback mechanism.  

We conducted this study with an intact team of developers working in an R\&D facility in India on a large industrial software system.  Developers were asked to volunteer for the pilot by their management, however, managers did not know who participated in the study.  We intended to keep managers out of the loop to reduce concerns among the developers that the data may be used for purposes other then the intended study.  By selecting an intact team, we hope to leverage aspects of motivation such as the Leaderboard to spur feelings of competition among teammates.  

\section{Related Work}
%update and expand

Johnson and Kou defined Zorro\cite{V:Johnson2007Automated}, a system for detecting whether developers use Test Driven Development techniques based on data from Hackystat.  Zorro divides development activities into episodes delimited by events such as configuration management code check-in, start of a unit test run, or start of a build.  Using the distinct events that developers follow within these episodes, Zorro determines whether the episode followed Test-Driven Development practices per their classic definition of test first - code - test pass, or a different scenario.  In two student-based studies comparing Zorro classifications with a simultaneous observational screen video, Zorro achieved between 70\% \cite{Kou2010Operational} and 89\% \cite{V:Johnson2007Automated} accuracy in classifying episodes into their proper TDD scenarios.  The studies did not, however, attempt to use or evaluate the influence of instant feedback aimed at encouraging participants to follow the classic definition of Test Driven Development.  In our study, we attempt this leap to present data collected directly to developers attempting to influence them to change their practices.

Murphy-Hill, Parnin, and Black \cite{V:MurphyHill2012How} use the Mylyn Monitor to explore whether or not developers use the automated refactoring tools present in Eclipse.  They look for specific refactoring commands in Eclipse and determine the amount of time developers use tools versus hand refactoring the code.  For this study we build a tool that captures the use of all commands within the Visual Studio environment including refactoring, navigation, and edit commands.

Robillard, Coelho and Murphy explore hypotheses around how developers can be more effective at performing a maintenance task \cite{wbsnipes:Robillard2004How}.  Key conclusions are that developers are more more successful finding and fixing bugs when they create a detailed plan for implementing a change, use structured navigation with keyword search or cross-reference search, and only review methods once during their search.  This builds on this work by testing methods for increasing the use of structured navigation in developers everyday practice.

Singer and Schneider demonstrate the use of a message board and points for encouraging students to increase their frequency of commits to the source code repository.\cite{Singer2012It}  The communication mechanism enabled students to see each others' progress and resulted in more frequent commits than baseline.  Participants valued the communication and collaboration aspect and some valued the competition enough to change their opinion on optimum commit frequency.  The subsequent thesis by Singer \cite{Singer2013a} describes results of an experiment conducted across two iterations of a class where active feedback on commits was deployed to one course and another course served as the control group where commit frequency was simply monitored.  Results show an increase in the frequency of commits at a statistically significant level.  This study uses finer grained instrumentation to identify practices being used between commits such as structured navigation.

The Pro Metrics (PROM) tool provides a framework for collecting data for further analysis from tools used by developers.\cite{Coman2009Casestudy}  It provides a flexible data model and a plug-in architecture to facilitate collection from different data sources.  Studies conducted using prom include a series of studies by it's creators on trends in time spent Pair Programming \cite{Coman2008Investigating}, benefits of refactoring on productivity \cite{Moser2008Case}, impact of refactoring on re-usability \cite{Moser2006Does}, and prediction of effort \cite{Abrahamsson2007Effort}.  The PROM tool and studies that use it track the time spent editing files and methods from the IDE and code metrics obtained trough source code analysis.  Applying these data to specific research questions such as whether refactoring improves productivity \cite{Moser2008Case} shows the utility of combining automated effort data with code metric data.  Taking a different focus on techniques, our study used more detailed events captured from the IDE  to detect how the user was navigating through the code in addition to knowing how long the editor is open for a particular file.

Murphy-Hill et. al. study a large usage history data set and apply several different algorithms to accurately suggest to users new commands in their environment to use.\cite{MurphyHill2012Improving} Algorithms based on command history performed well particularly when synchronized chronologically with the recipient's usage history. Novice users were better served by recommendation algorithms that did not require a long history, where more expert users benefited from more sophisticated algorithms that included more history. The "Most Widely Used" algorithm that recommends commands based on the collective usage profile of the team performed nearly as well as the more sophisticated algorithms. The paper presents the methodology for making recommendations and the evaluation of the accuracy of the recommendations. Our work goes the next step of evaluating whether a specific recommended practice gets adopted by developers when influenced through gamification methods.

Building on this success, this work proposes a generalized method to automate the identification of the techniques described in the related work and others, and determine when the techniques would help a developer improve their work patterns.  Then we intend to create a game-like virtual environment where developers learn from each other and are motivated to adopt the best practices developed by these and other researchers.

\section{Conclusions}
This paragraph will end the body of this sample document.
Remember that you might still have Acknowledgments or
Appendices; brief samples of these
follow.  There is still the Bibliography to deal with; and
we will make a disclaimer about that here: with the exception
of the reference to the \LaTeX\ book, the citations in
this paper are to articles which have nothing to
do with the present subject and are used as
examples only.
%\end{document}  % This is where a 'short' article might terminate

%ACKNOWLEDGMENTS are optional
\section{Acknowledgments}
This section is optional; it is a location for you
to acknowledge grants, funding, editing assistance and
what have you.  In the present case, for example, the
authors would like to thank Gerald Murray of ACM for
his help in codifying this \textit{Author's Guide}
and the \textbf{.cls} and \textbf{.tex} files that it describes.

%
% The following two commands are all you need in the
% initial runs of your .tex file to
% produce the bibliography for the citations in your paper.
\bibliographystyle{abbrv}
\balance
\bibliography{paper_id1} 
 % sigproc.bib is the name of the Bibliography in this case
% You must have a proper ".bib" file
%  and remember to run:
% latex bibtex latex latex
% to resolve all references
%
% ACM needs 'a single self-contained file'!
